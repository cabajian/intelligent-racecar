# Intelligent Self-driving Motorized Racecar

This was a semester-long project that involved programming an intelligent motorized racecar that could autonomously drive itself around a race track. The main controller for the car was a FRDM K64F microcontroller that connected to a motorshield to drive two DC motors, a linescan camera, and a steering servo. A full IEEE-standard paper was written and is available in the project source.
